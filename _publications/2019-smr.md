title: "MIDI Passage Retrieval Using Cell Phone Pictures of Sheet Music"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/sheet-midi-retrieval
#excerpt: 'This paper investigates a cross-modal retrieval problem in which a user would like to retrieve a passage of music from a MIDI file by taking a cell phone picture of a physical page of sheet music. While audio-sheet music retrieval has been explored by a number of works, this scenario is novel in that the query is a cell phone picture rather than a digital scan.'
