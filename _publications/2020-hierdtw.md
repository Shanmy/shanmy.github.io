title: "Improved handling of repeats and jumps in audio-sheet image synchronization"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-hierdtw
#excerpt: 'This paper studies the problem of automatically generating piano score following videos given an audio recording and raw sheet music images. Whereas previous works focus on synthetic sheet music where the data has been cleaned and preprocessed, we instead focus on developing a system that can cope with the messiness of raw, unprocessed sheet music PDFs from IMSLP.'
