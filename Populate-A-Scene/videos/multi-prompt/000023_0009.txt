The video shows a woman preparing the bay horse for a ride in the picturesque countryside. She is attaching the saddle securely, adjusting the stirrups, and fastening the girth while ensuring the horseâ€™s comfort. The woman is wearing a red flannel shirt, denim jeans, and leather riding boots, her hair tied back in a practical ponytail. Her gentle yet proficient handling reflects her experience and connection with the horse. In the background, the soothing sounds of nature and the sight of towering pines create a serene and idyllic setting for horseback riding.
