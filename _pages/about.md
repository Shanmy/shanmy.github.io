My name is Mengyi Shan (单梦伊) and I am currently a senior undergraduate student at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California, CA. I am pursuing double major in computer science and mathematics with a humanity and social science concentration in linguistics. I will be joining University of Washington for a PhD program in Computer Science.
