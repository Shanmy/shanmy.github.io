My name is Mengyi Shan (单梦伊) and I am currently a senior undergraduate student at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu) in Claremont, California, CA. I am pursuing double major in computer science and mathematics with a humanity and social science concentration in linguistics. I am fortunate to be advised by [Professor TJ Tsai](http://pages.hmc.edu/ttsai/) in the Music Information Retrieval Lab and by [Professor Weiqing Gu](https://math.hmc.edu/gu/) for my mathematics senior thesis on 3D Object Classification. I will be joining University of Washington [GRAIL](https://grail.cs.washington.edu) and [Reality Lab](https://realitylab.uw.edu) for a PhD program in Computer Science. 

Before college, I grew up in Beijing China. I spent seven years in the High School Affiliated to Renmin Univeristy of China where I was a member of the first class of Early Development Program (EDP). 

When I am not coding, I enjoy solving math puzzles, reading/writing detective fictions, learning languages, and playing music.
