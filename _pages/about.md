My name is Mengyi Shan (单梦伊) and I am currently a senior undergraduate student at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California, CA. I am pursuing double major in computer science and mathematics with a humanity and social science concentration in linguistics. I will be joining University of Washington for a PhD program in Computer Science. 

I spend my undergraduate years at Harvey Mudd College in California pursuing double major in Mathematics and Computer Science. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor TJ Tsai in the Music Information Retrieval Lab and by Professor Weiqing Gu for my mathematics senior thesis on 3D Object Classification. 

Before college, I grew up in Beijing China. I spent seven years in the High School Affiliated to Renmin Univeristy of China where I was a member of the first class of Early Development Program (EDP). 

When I am not coding, I enjoy solving math puzzles, reading/writing detective fictions, learning languages, and playing music.
